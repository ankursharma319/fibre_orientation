# fibre_orientation

Individual project. Algorithms for finding 3d fibre orientations from a stack of 2d images. Methods explored include - 

- Principal Component Analysis:
- Weighted Vector Summation
- Gradient orientation filters
- Fourier transform based approach

The orientation of fibres was to be presented as a vector field. Mathematica was used to implement the algorithms.

Mathematica notebooks are given in mathematica_notebooks folder. For selected sample code, look in the appendix of the report.pdf

For a quick overview of the project, look at poster.pdf
